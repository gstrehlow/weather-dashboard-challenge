## My Task
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- When I search for a city, then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- When I view current weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- When I view the UV index, then I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- When I click on a city in the search history, then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
