# Weather Dashboard

## My Task
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so that I can plan a trip accordingly.
